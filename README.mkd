wiki.Phong
==========

@tdfischer wouldn't release the sourcecode for the Phong which sends out
meeting reminders to the @synhak hackerspace. So I made one myself!

He does meeting pages based on these facts:

* Meetings are 2nd and 4th Thursday of every month
* Proposals can be proposed up until a week before the meeting
* Any proposals done in that week before the meeting carry over to the next
